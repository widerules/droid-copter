# Licence Information #

You guys can probably just ignore this page but I was looking at the Oracles lawsuit against Google and started thinking about licences. Though, it's not like a company would go after a few college students for breaking copyright laws, I felt like doing the research anyway. We have the full legal right to use code from the projects that we have talked about.

I did some research to see what kind of requirements there are for using other peoples code in our project. Under GPLv3 (The licence we are using), we have the freedom to use and modify other GPLv3 projects within our project. If the GPLv3 code contains a copyright notice at the top, we can still use and modify the code but we cannot remove that copyright notice. We also must include a name and date for a modified file at the top of a GPLv3 piece of code. Amarino and AeroQuad both use GPLv3 licencing, so, we can can freely use those.

Amarino uses a library from from http://code.google.com/p/android-bluetooth/. This is released under the Appache Licence 2.0. According to http://www.apache.org/licenses/GPL-compatibility.html, you can use code released under the Appache licence within the GPLv3 code but you cannot use GPLv3 code within software released under Appache. So . . . since we are using GPLv3 we are safe to use the code from these sources.

Keep in mind that if we are wanting to use code released as "GPLv2 only" then the law could get more complicated. On the other hand if it is marked as "GPLv2 or later" then we have the fully legal right to do so.
